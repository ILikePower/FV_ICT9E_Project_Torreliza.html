		<td>Fire risks fall under a broad category. It encompasses anything that prevents fire safe behavior from occurring as well as anything that hinders the operation of fire protection materials or equipment. For instance, both a broken sprinkler system and an obstacle that prevents a safe escape would be regarded as fire dangers. This is due to the fact that a facility's risk level influences both the likelihood that a fire would occur and the severity of the possible harm that could be caused by a fire, in the event that it did. Our perception of what constitutes a fire hazard has evolved through time; generally speaking, societies around the world are now less tolerant of fire risks, and as a result, a lot more situations are viewed as dangerous or unsafe. In light of this, a "fire hazard" is defined as anything that substantially raises the risk of a fire happening, intensifies the spread of a fire, or raises the potential harm a fire could do.</td>

		<td>There are several reasons why you should maintain a clean building. A fire can spread more quickly when there is a lot of clutter, especially flammable items like paper, cartons, and other items. Also, if there is a fire, the clutter may block exits and make it more difficult to escape. Thus, be sure to maintain a clutter-free and clean interior.</td>

Make sure to offer ashtrays or other secure choices so that people may put their cigarettes out properly and dispose of them. This will help prevent unintentional fires started by lighted cigarettes in your building.</td>
